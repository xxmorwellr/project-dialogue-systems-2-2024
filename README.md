# Fika Time UP!

It is my final project for the master course *Dialogue System 2*, and It's an ordering dialogue system based on *Llama 3.1*.

In previous coursework, I have realized chit-chatting with LLMs. This time I want to explore the dialogue capacities of LLMs within a landing senario, with a focus on how the model can involve local (custom) knowledge. Since I really enjoy fika time in Sweden, I want to imitate a role-playing dialogue between a barista and a customer.

You can see the brief [here](project.pdf).
